# Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates three popular page replacement algorithms used in operating systems to manage memory efficiently:

1. **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Removes the oldest page in memory.
2. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Removes the page that hasn't been used for the longest time.
3. **Optimal**: Removes the page that won't be used for the longest time in the future (ideal but impractical).

The simulator compares their performance by calculating:
- **Page Hits**: Number of times a page was found in memory, meaning we donâ€™t have to fetch it from the hard disk.
- **Page Faults**: Number of times a page was not found, requiring replacement, meaning we had to go fetch it from the hard disk.
- **Hit Ratio** and **Fault Ratio**.

## Features
- Configure frame size (memory capacity) to test algorithm behavior under different conditions.
- Display step-by-step progression of frames for each algorithm.
- Compare all three algorithms in a structured summary.

## How It Works
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - Page sequence and frame size.
2. **Simulation**:
   - The program applies the algorithms to the page sequence.
3. **Output**:
   - A detailed breakdown of frame states and a comparison table of performance metrics.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that you install Python 3.11.
